   - Prompt templates for consistent formatting

2. Chains
   - Sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities
   - Simple chains for basic tasks
   - Complex chains for multi-step reasoning

3. Data Augmented Generation
   - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Document loading and processing
   - Vector stores for semantic search
   - Integration with external data sources

4. Agents
   - LLMs that can use tools and take actions
   - Agent types: Zero-shot ReAct, Conversational ReAct, etc.
   - Custom tool creation and integration

5. Memory
   - Conversation memory for chat applications
   - Different memory types: buffer, summary, entity
   - Persistent memory storage
